Carotid stenosis .\n2. Aortic stenosis .\n3. Coronary artery disease .\nPRESENT ILLNESS :\nThe patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .\nThe patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .\nShe states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .\nShe denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .\nThe pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .\nCardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .\nPast medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .\nShe also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .\nShe has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .\nShe has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .\nMedications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .\nHEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .\nHer neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .\nChest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .\nCardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .\nHer abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .\nExtremi-ties :\nThere is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .\nLAB / X-RAY DATA :\nLabs on admission :\nSodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .\nEKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nShe was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .\nCarotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .\nOn 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .\nThis was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .\nShe was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .\nOn 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .\nThere was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .\nOn 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .\nHowever , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .\nShe was begun on a heparin drip .\nOn 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .\nShe underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .\nShe was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .\nShe was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .\nShe was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .\nShe was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .\nDISPOSITION :\nShe is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .\nDischarge medications :\nLopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .\nUpon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .\nDictated By :\nNIEIE FREIERM , M.D. ZX 681 / 0201 / RISHAN MISHON ROOM , M.D.\nBREUNTIK\nD :\n05/26/92\nT :\n05/27/92\nBatch :\nU886\nReport :\nLH486L9\n",

had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .\nShe evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .\nThe following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .\nIn the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .\nThere was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .\nShe was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to Well General Hospital .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\nIs notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. Freiermchird of Nash Health for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .\nHer Doxepin has recently been increased .\nShe is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .\nALLERGIES :\nQuinine gives her a rash .\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\nThe only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nShe is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .\nShe was born and raised in Atonlaremont Rockpo .\nThere is a history of childhood abuse .\nShe does not drink .\nShe is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nShe was pleasant , in no acute distress ;

there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .\nMental status - her speech was fluent without errors .\nHer affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .\nHer memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .\nVisual fields were full to confrontation .\nHer left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .\nHer right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .\nHer extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .\nThere was no nystagmus and no ptosis .\nHer saccades were normal .\nFacial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .\nHer tongue , uvula and palate were midline .\nShoulder shrug was 5/5 power .\nMotor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .\nThere was no drift .\nThere was normal bulk and tone .\nShe had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .\nSensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .\nReflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .\nThere was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .\nCoordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .\nOn standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .\nHer heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nWere unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .\nHer erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .\nHer coagulation parameters were normal .\nHead CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .\nHOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\nThe patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .\nA magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .\nShe had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .\nPosterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .\nOn the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .\nShe was seen by the Psychiatry Service .\nShe was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .\nThe psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .\nThe patient was evaluated in one of the neurology conferences for several hours , and during this time , showed significant improvement while receiving gait training as well as evaluation ; in particular , she became more stable with counter-balancing methods .\nThis trend of improvement continued , and she was discharged in stable condition .\nShe will follow up with her psychiatrist , Dr. Freiermchird ( Sone Memorial Hospital ) on a regular basis , and she can follow up with the Neurology Service on a p.r.n. basis if needed .\nShe will continue on her previous outpatient medical regimen .\nNIREGE MEMORY , M.D.\nTR :\nbzo\nDD :\n03/29/97\nTD :\n03/31/97 12:36 P\ncc :\nNYRI A MEMORY , M.D.\nASHELLRIETTE NESSASU THREATSVOT , M.D.\nEJEAN NADARC FREIERMCHIRD , M.D.\n",

STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .\n2. INTRAPARENCHYMAL BLEED .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Larsen was a 50-year-old salesman who in 12/26 was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .\nHe was found to have CML .\nHe was admitted on 06/07/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nUnremarkable .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nWhite blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .\nHis course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .\nOn 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .\nA bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .\nOn 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .\nIt was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .\nAlthough the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .\nBecause of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .\nNeurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .\nThe patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on 07/02/00 .\nDictated By :\nLAYMIE LARSEN , M.D. EM08\nAttending :\nANA V.

:\nThe patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .\nShe was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .\nA small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .\nShe was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .\nThis was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .\nFor a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .\nShe has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .\nTrace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .\n4-to 4+ strength at the

bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .\nThe patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .\nA chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .\nInitially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .\nSputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .\nA left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .\nThe patient is on Ciprofloxacin .\nThe day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .\nShe has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .\nShe also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .\nOnce her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .\nShe has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .\nThe patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .\nThese have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .\nThe exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .\nThe patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .\nIron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .\nThe plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .\nThe patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .\nThis is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .\nThis must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .\nThe patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .\nThis may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .\nHer sodiums were never below 130 .\nShe does well with tube feeds .\nHer tube feeds orders are as follow :\nfull strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .\nIn addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .\nShe also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .\nShe also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .\nPlease note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .\nIt is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .\nShe has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .\nShe did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .\nIn the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .\nThis did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .\nAs of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .\nHer cholesterol was 350 here .\nShe has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .\nThese can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .\nNote that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\nMetamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a

Hospital And Medical Center .\nHowever , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .\nOver the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .\nHe has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .\nHe also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .\nAt the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .\nHe was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .\nBlood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .\nBlood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\nHe was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .\nA Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .\nHe was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n1) Multiple myeloma .\n2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\n3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .\n4) Chronic renal insufficiency .\n5) Chronically low platelet count .\n6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 .\n7) Hypothyroidism .\nFAMILY HISTORY :\nPositive for diabetes mellitus .\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nMarried to a very supportive wife .\nALLERGIES :\nQuestion of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .\nMEDICATIONS :\nOn transfer include Vancomycin , Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Solu Cortef 100 mg q8h , Lasix , Synthroid , insulin , MS Contin 60 mg b.i.d. , MSO4 2 mg p.r.n. pain IV , Dopamine 12 mcg per minute .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 .\nHEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .\nNeck supple , carotids without bruits .\nCardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .\nChest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .\nAbdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\nRectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .\nExtremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .\nThere was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .\nNeurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .\nCranial nerves intact .\nMotor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .\nStrength was decreased in both lower extremities .\nCoordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .\nDeep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .\nGlucose 191 .\nPT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .\nMagnesium 1.7 .\nUA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .\nChest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .\nAn MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .\nThere was no CSF density .\nThese findings were consistent with the cord compression .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nBy problems -\n1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :\nThe patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .\nBlood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .\nThere were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .\nThe organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .\nHe was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .\nHe was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .\nThe Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .\nIn addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .\nVancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .\nHe was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .\nHe is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .\nThese dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .\nOf note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .\nThe plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .\nAs mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .\nThe cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .\n2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\nThe patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .\nHe was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .\nHe has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .\nAn echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .\nThe patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .\nHe has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .\nThe plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .\n3) ONCOLOGY :\nThe patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .\nHe has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .\nThe plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .\nThe patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .\n4) NEUROLOGIC :\nAs mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .\nHe was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.\nHis neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .\nHis Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .\nHis Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .\n5) BLOOD SUGARS :\nThe patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .\nHe has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .\nThe plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .\n6) RESPIRATORY :\nHe initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .\nHowever , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .\nHe can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .\n7) NUTRITION :\nThe patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .\nHe has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .\nHe should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .\n8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :\nBoth of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .\nHis PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .\nThis has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .\nWe have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .\nHe also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .\nThrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .\nDISPOSITION :\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nTylenol 650 mg po q4h p.r.n. , Dulcolax 10 mg per rectum b.i.d. p.r.n. , Decadron 5 mg IV q6h , Digoxin 0.25 mg po q day , Colace 100 mg po t.i.d. , Florinef 0.1 mg po q day for presumed adrenal insufficiency , Imipenem 500 mg IV q6h , insulin

:\n02/18/1991\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :\n1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .\n2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .\n3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .\nMr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .\nHe was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .\nHe was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .\nHe initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .\nAt discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .\nHe was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .\nOn 02/06/91 , he was seen in FLFDMC and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .\nHe was evaluated in the Emergency Room .\nAt that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .\nCultures were taken and he was sent out .\nOn 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\nHe was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\nReview of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\nHis oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .\n2) Recent PCP .\n3) Status post right elbow surgery .\n4) Venereal disease history .\n5) PPD anergic .\nThe patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .\nSKIN :\nJaundiced .\nHEENT :\nRevealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .\nNECK :\nHe had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .\nLUNGS :\nHad tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .\nCARDIAC :\nShowed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\nThere was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\nABDOMEN :\nSoft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .\nHis liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .\nHis spleen was not palpable .\nRECTAL :\nHe had guaiac positive stools .\nEXTREMITIES :\nUnremarkable .\nGENITOURINARY :\nHis penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .\nNEUROLOGICAL :\nNon-focal .\nLABORATORY EXAMINATION :\nOn admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .\nPT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .\nSodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .\nALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .\n( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .\nHis arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .\nHis chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nThe patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\nIn terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\nHe was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\nThe patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\nHe was given supplemental oxygen .\nIn terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\nTiters for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\nStool was sent for ova and parasites .\nGastrointestinal was consulted .\nInitially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\nHowever , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\nActually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\nOn 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\nHe was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\nAlso of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\nHowever , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\nThe patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\nThe patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .\nThe patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\nOn 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\nNo other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .\nThe patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\nHe required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\nFortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\nHowever , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\nPatient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\nThe patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\nThese were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\nThey felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\nBone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\nDiscussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\nDue to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\nThis was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\nPatient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient died in hospital .\nAn autopsy will be performed .\nAn autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .\nWE221/9850 TAKO C.

Pulmonary .\nFrom a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .\nHis apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .\nChest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .\nHowever , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .\nOn the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .\nChest xray is still consistent with volume overload .\nThe plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .\n3.

Oncology .\nThe patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .\nHowever , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .\nHis pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .\nAs he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .\nDiscussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .\nCode status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .\nThis is an unfortunate case but Mr. Po does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\nTylenol , 650 mg p.o. q 4 prn ; Allopurinol , 100 mg p.o. q.d. ; Peridex mouthwash , 10 ml b.i.d.; cholysteramineresin , 4 grams p.o. q.d. ; clotrimazole , one troche p.o. q.i.d. ; Fentanyl patch , 100 mcg per hour topical q 72 hours ; glipizide , 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Atarax , 25 operating table 50 mg p.o. q 6 to 8 hours prn itching ; regular sliding scale insulin ; KBL mouthwash , 15 ccp .o. q.d. prn mouth discomfort ; Lactulose , 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. that was started on January 30 , for no bowel movements with instructions to continue until bowel movement and then decrease to b.i.d. or q.d. ; Lidocaine , 2% , 10 ml UR q 3 to 4 hours prn for pain around Foley site ; Ativan , 0.25 to 0.5 mg IV q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety with instructions to use caution .\nThe patient gets very somnolent with Ativan .\nMaalox Plus , Extra Strength , 15 cc p.o. q 6 hours prn indigestion ; magnesium sulfate ; sliding scale IV and potassium chloride , sliding scale IV .\nHe is also on Reglan , 10 mg p.o. q h ; Miracle topical cream to affected area ; also Sarna , topical cream , b.i.d.\nHe has Nystatin suspension mouthwash , 10 cc swish and swallow q.i.d.

Wave .\nIn the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .\nPotassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past .\nDISCHARGE REGIMEN :\nDigoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.\nCA SHUFF , M.D.\nTR :\nvw / bmot\nDD :\n11-06-93\nTD :\n11/07/93\nCC :\nCopies to Dr. Bodejove at Valtawnprinceel Community Memorial Hospital , Dr. A Eu Wave , Dr. Riemund C.

METASTATIC PROSTATE CA .\n2. OBSTRUCTIVE UROPATHY , STATUS POST LEFT NEPHROSTOMY .\n3. HYPERTENSION .\n4. ANEMIA .\n5. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE .\nCHIEF COMPLAINT :\nThis 88-year-old male with history of prostate CA was admitted from an outside hospital secondary to persistent hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to Retelk County Medical Center for further management .\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\nMr. Prehekote is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .\nHe received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .\nAfter that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .\nThe patient was admitted on February 23 , 1999 to Eifro Medical Center because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .\nHe was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .\nBUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .\nProstate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .\nFurther evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .\nBecause of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .\nHowever after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .\nHis hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .\nHe also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .\nDue to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from Eifro Medical Center to the Retelk County Medical Center for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .\nThe patient was transferred to Genearocktemp Ry Health on March 3 , 1999 .\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\nThe patient had constipation with dysuria , but no fever or chills .\nNo cough .\nNo chest pain .\nNo palpitations , history of epigastric pain and body weight loss .\nNo headache .\nNo bone pain .\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n1) Hypertension .\n2) Gastroesophageal reflux disease .\n3) Anemia .\n4) Prostate CA .\nALLERGIES :\nNo known drug allergies .\nMEDICATIONS :\nClonidine 2.5 milligrams topical q. week , Nitropaste 2 inches q.4h. , Nilandron 50 milligrams p.o. q.d. , Lupron , Dulcolax p.r.n. , Colace 100 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , Ferrous sulfate 300 milligrams p.o. b.i.d. , Lansopiacole 15 milligrams p.o. q.d. , bethanechol 25 milligrams p.o. t.i.d.\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\nThe patient has been living in the Kansas for more than 20 years .\nHe was originally from Wark and he speaks Portuguese only .\nHe is now living with his son and daughter , and five other children .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nOn admission , the patient was a frail looking elderly male lying in bed in no acute distress .\nTemperature 95.4 , pulse 120 , blood pressure 150/80 , respiratory rate 24 , 95% on room air .\nConjunctiva were not pale .\nSclera nonicteric .\nPupils :\nIsocoric cataract bilaterally .\nMouth :\nMucous membranes slightly dry .\nNo oral ulcers .\nNeck :\nSupple .\nJugular vein not engorged .\nCarotid pulses bounding very strongly .\nNo thyromegaly .\nChest examination showed some basilar crackles at the right lung base .\nHeart initially tachycardia , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the left sternal border .\nAbdomen :\nSoft .\nLiver and spleen were not palpable .\nBowel sounds normoactive .\nExtremities :\nTraced pitting edema .\nNo cyanosis and no clubbing .\nPeripheral pulses were very strong and bounding .\nNo calf tenderness .\nHoman &apos;s sign negative .\nNeurologic :\nExamination was limited because the patient speaks only Portuguese .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .\nLiver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .\nCBC :\nWBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .\nPT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .\nChest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .\nNo lung infiltrate .\nCT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .\nA mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .\nThe CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .\nEKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .\nCK enzymes 146 .\nRepeated three times and remained flat .\nTroponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nAfter admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .\nThe specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .\nUrology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .\nAfter admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .\nHe was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .\nAfter transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .\nThe patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .\nHe continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .\nDuring this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .\nCPK was tracked , but was totally normal .\nNo beta blockers were given .\nA long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .\nDr. Lucreamull discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. Prehekote could return home with hospice .\nThe patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles will manage the hospice issues .\nThe patient was discharged to home for hospice on March 8 , 1999 .\nDISCHARGE
