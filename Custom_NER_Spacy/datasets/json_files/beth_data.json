SOB : Most consistent with CHF by exam , although unknown what the severity of her COPD is currently .\nTTE revealed large pericardial effusion .\nPt is now s/p drainage of right pleural effusion , diagnostic and therapeutic , with studies consistent with transudate , etiology most likely 02-15 CHF .\nWe continued her albuterol / atrovent nebs , diuresis with IV lasix drip and boluses .\nHer 05-27 CXR post procedure w/o PNX , effusion much improved , yet her 05-28 CXR worse than 05-27 with some reaccumulation of right pleural effusion .\nThen , on 05-29 , she demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions ( reaccumulated ), right lower lobe infiltrate ( started on vanco / zosyn )-> put on face mask , given lasix x 1 bolus 100 mg , responded somewhat and o2 sat stable in low 90 s.\nShe was given 200 mg IV lasix X 1 with an additional 100 cc of urine output the evening of 5/16 .\nHer lasix gtt continued during this time .\nHer oxygen sats did not improve .\nShe was then made CMO .\nSee above .\n#. Pericardial effusion : unclear etiology , OSH had raised question of RV perforation from pacer , however she had a normal echo appearance of lead , no tamponade by exam .\nThis has still be known to occur during the placement of pacemaker .\nIt was felt posthumously that her large pericardial effusion was most likely secondary to a complication of pacer placement , although this was not seen on imaging .\nIn the last 12 hours of her life , her pulsus was 12 , and she was felt to likely to have aspect of tamponade physiology , since her preload was reduced .\n#. CHF : normal EF on TTE so possibly with diastolic dysfunction , ruled out for MI\n- See course of diuresis above .\n- We continued ASA / imdur / CCB / hold diovan until pt was made CMO .\n#. Pleural effusions : Likely due to CHF although had some leukocytosis at admission to OSH .\nMary studies c/w transudate .\n- After she was made CMO , the pt was started on Morphine gtt to maximize comfort and minimize air hunger .\n#. Afib/SSS : She was A-paced , pacer placed 05-08 in DDDR mode , complicated by PTX requiring chest tube which resolved and tube was removed during admit for pacer , no evidence of PTX on most recent CXR .\nHer pacer wires in correct position .\nWe continued amiodarone until pt was made CMO .\nAnticoagulation has not been given this admission .\nShe was a poor anticoagulation candidate .\nWe started her on dilt for additional a fib control ( revert back to a fib on 05-29 ), which was stopped when the pt was made CMO .\n#. Oliguric ARF : likely prerenal due to n/v poor po intake and poor forward flow , However , need to continue diuresis .\nHer urine lytes consistent with ATN , FENA 4% .\nRenal u/s negative for hydronephrosis .\nRenal consultants did not feel that there was an indication for urgent hemodialysis .\nShe continued to put out low amounts of urine throughout the admission , despite aggressive diuresis with IV lasix gtt and boluses .\nSee above .\n#. ID : initially had leukocytosis at admission , with chest CT showing possible underlying consolidations vs. atelectasis , levoflox started 05-24 and subsequently stopped ( no consolidations on CXR and afebrile ).\nU/A on 05-27 c/w UTI .\nPt now on IV Ceftriaxone ( was on levoflox since 05-24 however UA now floridly positive ( more so than UA at OSH ) so felt possibly levo-resistant .\nPt started on CTX 05-27 .\nShe was empirically started on vanco/zosyn for empiric hosp acquired pna coverage\n- possible opacity on CXR - along w/ leukocytosis .\n#. Anemia : Unclear source .\nShe was guiaic negative .\n- no transfusions , CMO/DNR/DNI\n#. FEN : check lytes , most recently normal .\ncardiac/renal diet\n#. Access : PIV\n#.

this was thought to be secondary to a more pervasive process , likely anoxic encephalopathy , for which the prognosis is extremely grim .\nThis was discussed at length in several family meetings involving the patient 's wife , son , primary care doctor , ICU attending , and neurology consultant in the presence of a Asian interpreter .\nThe end result of these discussion was that the patient 's wishes would not be consistent with this new level of functioning from which he had little hope of recovery ; the family decided to make him comfort measures only .\nHe was disconnected from the ventilator and all medications beyond a morphine drip were stopped , and he expired shortly thereafter .\nThe family was present .\nMedications on Admission :\nJevity 1.2 65 mL / hour continuous with water 240 cc q 8 hours\nLasix 40 mg IV QAM ( given 08-14 )\nVancomycin 1 gm IV q 36 hours ( last dose at 2000 on 08-13 ) .\nStarted on 08-09 )\nASA 325 mg PO QD\nLansoprazole 30 mg PO QAM\nHeparin 5000 units SC TID\nZosyn 4.5 gm IV q 8 hours ( last dose on 08-14 at 1400 ) , started 08-08 .\nMetoprolol 37.5 mg q 12 hours ( last dose 07/25 in AM )\nProtein / Soy supplement 2 scoops q 12 hours\nIpratropium / Albuterol inhaler 4 puffs QID\nCompleted course of Flagyl 07-25 --> 08-10 .\nDischarge Disposition :\nExpired\nDischarge Diagnosis :\nAnoxic encephalopathy\nAcute respiratory failure\nChronic respiratory failure\nPseudomonal pneumonia\nVolume overload\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nBronchiectasis\nHyponatremia\nAnemia of chronic disease\nSecondary :\n1.

Marked interval enlargement of the cardiac silhouette .\nTogether with the interval development of bilateral pleural effusions , this indicates cardiac insufficiency ( or alternatively volume overload ) and an echocardiogram may be indicated for further evaluation .\n2. Bilateral basilar compressive atelectasis .\nSuperimposed infectious consolidation is likely .\n3. Interval development of tree-in-Eric nodular opacities and scattered ground glass opacities involving the right lung , concerning for an infectious process .\nThe differential diagnosis of this is wide including viral , fungal and atypical mycobacterial infections .\nDrug toxicity would be a consideration , although somewhat less likely given the unilaterality of the findings .\n4. New jejunal wall thickening with persistent distal ileal wall thickening and diffuse mesenteric stranding , most likely reflecting an infectious etiology .\n5. Overall stability in metastatic burden .\n4) ECHO ( 06-18 ): Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved biventricular systolic function .\nMild posterior mitral valve prolapse with mild mitral regurgitation .\nSmall ( 0.6 cm ) circumferential pericardial effusion , largest around the left atrium .\n5) L femur xray ( 06-18 ): Predominantly sclerotic lesion with interval periosteal new bone formation involving the intertrochanteric and subtrochanteric regions .\nNo displaced fracture is demonstrated .\nBrief Hospital Course :\nMr. Mcelveen 51 year-old male with metastatic RCC on Sutent since 2018-12-21 , admitted with fever , hypoxemia , and bibasilar pneumonia .\n1) Bibasilar pneumonia : Patient was treated for community-acquired pneumonia .\nHe was initially placed on Ceftriaxone , Levaquin , and Flagyl in the ICU but then changed to \nAzithromycin & CTX at time of transfer to the oncology service .\nHe continued to have an oxygen requirement and CT scan suggested ground glass opacities , suggestive of an underlying infectious process .\nECHO was done and confirmed normal ejection fraction .\nHis respiratory status improved slowly , oxygen was weaned off , and he was discharged on course of Levaquin .\n2) Metastatic RCC : Sutent was held on admission in light of acute infection .\nHe underwent a staging CT scan torso which suggested no significant increase in tumor burden .\nPatient was also found to have abnormal TFTs on Sutent and was started on replacement \ntherapy .\nHe will need follow-up bloodwork as an outpatient .\nRecent CT scan showed destruction of L femoral neck .\nHe underwent an xray of the L femur which did not suggest an acute fracture .\nNo limitations were placed in regards to weightbearing status .\nPatient was instructed to restart Sutent next Monday .\n3) Renal insufficiency : Creatinine improved from 2.1 to 1.3 at time of discharge .\nLikely related to underlying malignancy as well as prerenal component given improvement with gentle hydration .\nMedications on Admission :\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : He takes Imodium and Lomotil while on Sutent for diarrhea .\nHe has not had a BM in 3 days now .\nHe is also on MS Contin 45 mg PO q12 hours ( confirmed with wife ) and MSIR 15 mg every 4 hours as needed .\nMEDICATIONS ON TRANSFER :\nHeparin 5000 UNIT SC TID\nAlbuterol 0.083% Neb Soln 1 NEB IH Q6H\nIpratropium Bromide Neb 1 NEB IH Q6H\nCeftriaXONE 1 gm IV Q24H\nLevofloxacin 500 mg PO Q24H\nMorphine Sulfate 2-4 mg IV Q4H : PRN\nDocusate Sodium 100 mg PO BID\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO Q24H\nFluticasone Propionate 110mcg 2 PUFF IH BID\nDischarge Medications :\n1.

Hypotension : The patient 'd pm BP meds were held 11-14 and she was administered 1.5L NS over the course of the day with subsequent SBP s in the high 90 s, low 100 s,.\nThe hypotension was likely due to volume depletion caused by her diarrhea / loose stools in addition to decreased PO intake secondary to her GERD and thrush .\nAll of this occurred in the setting of aggressive BP management with metoprolol 25 BID , HCTZ / Triampterene ( as a replacment for lasix due to recurrent hypokalemia ), Benicar 20 mg QD , and Imdur 30 mg QD .\nInfection / sepsis was not likely given she was afebrile and had no localizing sx with an improving lung exam and 02 requirement .\nGiven the patient 's recent RP bleed , there was concern for a recurrent bleed .\nHer groin exam was unchanged .\nHer Hct dropped from Hct 38.9 before fluids to 35.5 s/p 1.5L NS and was thought to be dilutional .\nRepeat hcts were stable .\nThe patient was kept an additional two days to follow her hcts and titrate her BP meds .\nAs volume depletion was thought to be the cause of her low BP , only the BBlocker was restarted .\nShe was also placed on on low dose spironolactone as a K sparing diuretic and for BP control in addition to Toprol XL 25 mg QD for her coronary disease .\nShe tolerated these meds with SBP s in the high 90 s to 100 s and was therefore discharged on this regimen .\nShe will need follow up with her PCP within B week after discharge from the extended care facility for further BP titration and monitoring of her electrolytes .\n2. Thrush : This is likely secondary to her steroid inhalers and PO prednisone for COPD exacerbation .\nShe was started on nystatin swish and swallow QID .\nThe patient was encouraged to take PO liquids to prevent volume depletion .\n3. diarrhea : The patient has been having loose stools at night and was guiac pos x 2 .\nStool for C.diff toxin was sent x 1 and was negative .\nHer bowel regimen is prn .\nGastroenteritis is possible but she has no vomiting and only occ nausea with meds .\nThere is no evidence of obstruction on AXR .\nTherefore , the cause of her mild diarrhea ( few loose BM / liquid stool / night ) may be either viral or secondary to resolving abdominal hematoma with resultant irritation of GI system .\nWe have advised a BRAT diet .\n4. guiac pos stool : Given the patient 's sx of GERD , current PO steroid regimen , and ASA for her stents , the ddx for her guiac positive stools would include gastritis / gastric ulcer in addition to lower GI pathology .\nHowever , she has no vomiting and only mild nausea with medications .\nShe also has no gross blood per rectum and her hct is stable .\nUpon discharge the patient was changed to a BID protonix regimen .\nDr. Valerio office was notified about the patient 's discharge plans and status .\nShe will need outpatient follow up for her guiac pos stools with endoscopy vs EGD +/- H.pylori serologies .\nA copy of this dc summary will be faxed to her PCP to ensure proper follow up .\nDischarge Medications :\n1.

Ursodiol 600 mg t.i.d.\n2. Ambien 5 mg q.h.s.\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :\nThe patient is a jaundiced looking gentlemen in no acute distress .\nThe head is normocephalic , atraumatic and eyes are icteric .\nThe neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy .\nThe chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally .\nThe heart has a regular rate and rhythm with normal S1 , S2 .\nThere is no murmurs .\nThe abdomen was soft , nontender , no masses and nondistended .\nThere is no hepatosplenomegaly .\nRectal exam showed no masses and is guaiac negative .\nThe extremities have distal pulses and were warm and well perfused .\nNeurological exam was grossly intact .\nLABORATORY STUDIES AT ADMISSION :\nA white blood cell count of 14.2 , hematocrit of 35.3 , platelet count of 449,000 .\nSodium of 130 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 15 , creatinine 1.1, prothrombin time 14.1 , partial thrombin time 29.7 .\nINR 1.4 .\nALT 106 , AST 149 , alkaline phosphatase 242 .\nTotal bilirubin 10.1 , amylase 90 and lipase 112 .\nRADIOLOGICAL STUDIES AT TIME OF ADMISSION :\nChest x-ray revealed minimal left base atelectasis and elevation of left hemidiaphragm .\nA CT scan with po contrast showed dilation of intrahepatic common bile duct which is improved from previous studies .\nIt is also noted that there was splenomegaly .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nMr. Cordano was admitted on 2009-08-17 for a replacement of transhepatic biliary drainage catheter .\nAt that time , cholangiogram confirmed that there was a distal stricture of the common bile duct .\nAn endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography also demonstrated similar findings\nand it is noted there was nodularity in the common bile duct which is worrisome for cholangiocarcinoma .\nTherefore , the patient was taken to the Operating Room on 2009-08-24 for a Whipple procedure versus hepaticojejunostomy .\nOn exploration of the abdomen revealed significant nodularity of the liver indicating of advanced cirrhosis .\nIntraoperative frozen section of the distal and proximal common bile duct in the\nregion nodularity , which is identified previously by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , and regional lymph nodes were all sent to pathology .\nThey were all negative for malignancy and therefore a hepaticojejunostomy\nwas performed .\nCholangiogram on postoperative day number two showed no evidence of leakage at the anastomosis site .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and he was sent to the floor in stable condition .\nThe patient 's postoperative course was notable for an elevation in white blood cell count peaking at 30.0 on postoperative day number two .\nHe was given Unasyn for empiric antibiotic treatment .\nAt the time , blood , urine and bile was sent for culture , which were all negative .\nA chest x-ray was also negative for any pneumonia .\nPostoperatively , Mr. Cordano also suffered from low urine output ranges between 25 to 30 cc per hour .\nFractional excretion of sodium was less than 1% suggesting a prerenal etiology .\nThe sodium creatinine peaked at 2.0 and the patient was treated with boluses of intravenous fluid and intravenous albumin infusion was also administered .\nHe responded well to this regimen and made adequate urine output .\nAt the same time , the patient also developed distentions of the abdomen consistent with accumulation of ascitic fluid .\nHe also had significant lower extremity and scrotum edema .\nOn postoperative day number eight , the patient 's oxygen saturation dropped to 85% on room air and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for fluid management .\nChest x-ray and sputum culture obtained at the time were negative and the patient was treated with 100% nonrebreather which improved his oxygenation .\nWhile he is in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit , paracentesis was performed and it\nrevealed greater than 24,000 white blood cell count in the ascites which is consistent with SVT .\nHe was given Zosyn for empiric treatment .\nGram stain and culture of the ascites failed to identify any organism .\nHe was weaned from oxygen requirement and was continued on normal saline boluses and\nintravenous albumin for treatment of prerenal azotemia .\nSomatostatin and midodrine were also given for this condition and he also received packed red blood cells .\nOn postoperative day number ten , the patient returned to the floor with improved renal function and without oxygen requirement .\nThe somatostatin and the midodrine were discontinued and the regimen of Lasix and spironolactone was started for diuresis .\nHis creatinine levels trended toward normal and the fractional excretion of sodium also increased indicating a resolution of the prerenal kidney failure .\nOn postoperative day number 17 , the patient was discharged .\nAt the time he took good po .\nHe has a PICC line in place for continued treatment with Rocephin and he will have a visiting nurse to help him to administer these medications .\nWhile in the hospital , the patient received initial work-up including echocardiogram , electrocardiogram and serology studies to be listed for liver transplant .\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n1. Rocephin 1 gram q.d.\n2. Furosemide 10 mg q.d.\n3. Spironolactone 100 mg q.d.\n4. Ursodiol 600 mg po t.i.d.\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\nStable .\nDISCHARGE STATUS :\nTo home with services .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nPSC , status post hepaticojejunostomy .\nHope Raymond , M.D. , Ph.D.\n02-366\nDictated By : Alden B.

NEUROLOGY : The patient complained of left lower extremity weakness with ambulation two days after her cardiac catheterization .\nThe patient had no evidence for weakness on examination with good proximal and distal strength in the lower extremities as well as intact sensation .\nThe patient worked with Physical Therapy and was able to ambulate without difficulty .\nShe was also able to ascend stairs without difficulty .\nThe patient was already on an aspirin and Plavix should this represent a small stroke .\nHowever , there was no evidence for neurologic deficit on examination and this will be followed-up by her primary care physician .\n5. HEMATOLOGY : The patient was discharged on Coumadin for apical akinesis and stroke risk .\nThis will be further monitored by her primary care physician , Dr. Banks , who will adjust her Coumadin dose .\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE : Stable .\nDISCHARGE STATUS : To home .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS : ST elevation myocardial infarction , status post left anterior descending artery stent .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\n1. Aspirin 325 q.d.\n2. Lisinopril 5 q.d.\n3. Toprol XL 100 q.d.\n4. Coumadin 5 q.d.\n5. Plavix 75 q.d.\n6. Lovenox 60 mg b.i.d. until therapeutic on Coumadin .\n7. Pravastatin 80 q.d.\nFOLLOW-UP PLANS : The patient will follow-up with her primary care physician in the week following discharge for further monitoring of her INR and adjustment of her Coumadin dose .\nThe patient will also follow-up with Electrophysiology with Dr. Welch on 2015-07-24 .\nIn addition to this , the patient will follow-up with Cardiology , Dr. Foster , and Dr. Upshaw , on 2015-07-06 for further monitoring .\nJoshua PINTO , M.D. 12.932\nDictated By : Greg E.

Hypotension - The patient was initially mildly hypotensive with systolic blood pressures in the 80s .\nUpon admission it was unclear whether or not the patient was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\nInitially he was treated with intravenous fluids with a dramatic response in his systolic blood pressure .\nHowever , subsequent it was determined that the patient 's hypotension may have been related to his rapid ventricular response and right heart failure .\nTherefore the focus of treatment was changed to controlling his rate .\n2. Atrial fibrillation - The patient 's Digoxin had been weaned off prior to his admission .\nIt was felt that this potentially had lead to his atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response .\nThe patient was loaded once again with Digoxin and his beta blocker was increased to 100 mg of Lopressor , three times a day .\nIn addition the patient was started on Verapamil since his heart rate had remained mildly tachycardiac in the low 100s .\n3. Congestive heart failure - During the initial course of the patient 's admission , it was unclear as to whether or not he was volume overloaded or volume depleted .\nThe patient was initially treated with intravenous fluids , however , subsequently he was diuresed when he became symptomatic and short of breath .\nChest x-rays revealed evidence of congestive heart failure .\nThe decision was made to have the patient undergo a cardiac catheterization to fully evaluate the hemodynamics to determine the etiology of the patient 's heart failure .\nIn addition , plans were made to evaluate the patient 's cardiac arteries to determine if he had any component of ischemic cardiomyopathy .\n4. Abnormal liver function tests - The patient had an isolated , elevated alkaline phosphatase with a confirmatory elevation in his gamma glutamyl transferase .\nAn ultrasound of the right upper quadrant did not reveal any cholelithiasis or cholecystitis , however , an irregular hepatic contour was seen which is suggestive of underlying chronic liver disease .\nThere was some concern that the patient may have a partial biliary obstruction and the patient was sent for an magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography to further evaluate the biliary system .\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography did not reveal any evidence of biliary dilatation or of any obstructing pancreatic mass .\nAgain seen was a slightly irregular contour of the liver with dilated hepatic veins suggesting chronic hepatic vascular congestion .\nThe patient also revealed a prior history of heavy alcohol use for approximately 20 years , during the mid 1950s to mid 1970s .\nIt was felt that he may have had some component of vascular congestion from his congestive heart failure as well as possibly some mild cirrhotic changes secondary to his previous alcohol use .\n5. Fall - The patient had a mechanical fall during his admission .\nHe did not sleep at all the night before and was extremely fatigued .\nHe was walking in the hall , dragging his intravenous pole when he tripped over the foot of the pole and lost his balance .\nHe fell backwards , landing on his buttocks and bumped his head .\nHis neurological examination at that time was nonfocal and the head was atraumatic without any evidence of a hematoma .\nA computerized axial tomography scan of his head at that time did not reveal any extra or intracranial hemorrhage .\n6. Rectal bleeding - The patient has a history of rectal bleeding , ever since his brachytherapy for his prostate cancer .\nThe patient has been treated with Argon laser therapy in the past for his rectal bleeding and it is recommended that he follow up with his gastroenterologist for repeat Argon laser therapy .\nThe remainder of the hospital course will be dictated by the covering intern .\nSheila Providence , M.D. 50-442\nDictated By : Marjorie I.

Integrelin drip on transfer .\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\nVital signs :\nHeart rate 91 , regular , blood pressure 169/81 from a right groin A line , respirations 12 , oxygen saturation of 97 percent on 2 liters nasal cannula .\nGeneral :\nHe was a well appearing male in no acute distress .\nHEENT :\nCrusting around the right eyelid but the pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .\nHe was edentulous .\nNeck :\nThe neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly .\nCardiovascular :\nHis heart was regular with a normal S1 and S2 .\nHe had no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .\nLungs :\nHis lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally Anteriorly and laterally .\nAbdomen :\nSoft , obese , nontender , nondistended .\nHe had normoactive bowel sounds .\nExtremities :\nThere was a right groin A line and a left groin venous sheath with a Swan .\nHe had no evident edema .\nHe had 2+ dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses bilaterally .\nNeurologic :\nHe was alert and oriented times three , moving all extremities .\nLABORATORY DATA :\nOn admission , the CBC revealed a white count of 7.4 , hematocrit 39.7 , and platelets of 217,000 .\nSerum chemistries revealed a sodium of 135, potassium 4.0 , chloride 102 , bicarbonate 26 , BUN 29 , creatinine 1.6 , and glucose of 111 .\nThe initial EKG showed normal sinus rhythm at a rate of 71 with a normal axis and evidence of first-degree AV block with prolonged PR interval of 238 milliseconds .\nHe also had a widened QRS of 153 milliseconds , an old right bundle branch block , and no acute ST or T wave changes .\nThe EKG was prior to catheterization and the one post PTCA was no different .\nHe had a bedside echocardiogram done in the Catheterization Laboratory which showed normal LV wall thickness and normal LV cavity size .\nThere was no evidence of effusion .\nIt was difficult to assess free wall motion .\nCardiac catheterization revealed a totally occluded RCA with collaterals , an 80 percent LAD lesion extending distally which was angioplastied but no stent was placed .\nHemodynamics :\nThe right heart catheterization revealed pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 4 , cardiac output of 8 , and cardiac index of 3.8 , he had an RA pressure of 10 , RV pressure of 43/4 , PA pressure of 37/10 .\nASSESSMENT :\nThis is an 82 - year-old male with a history of prior tobacco use , hypertension , chronic renal insufficiency , COPD , gastritis , and TIA who initially presented to Braintree with a non-ST elevation MI and Guaiac positive stools , transferred to St. Margaret's Center for Women & Infants for cardiac catheterization with PTCA to mid LAD lesion complicated by hypotension and bradycardia requiring Atropine , IV fluids and transient dopamine possibly secondary to vagal reaction , subsequently transferred to CCU for close monitoring , hemodynamically stable at the time of admission to the CCU .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\n1. CARDIOVASCULAR :\nAs summarized above , the patient had a non-ST elevation MI with evidence of an 80 percent mid LAD lesion for which he underwent angioplasty without stent placement .\nHe was initially continued on aspirin , Plavix , beta blocker , statin , and ACE inhibitor .\nAt the time of discharge , his Plavix was held due to Guaiac positive stools and hematocrit drop throughout admission .\nHe had a transthoracic echocardiogram the day after admission showing an ejection fraction of greater than 60 percent .\nNo focal wall motion abnormalities .\nHe had no recurrent chest pain or shortness of breath throughout admission .\nIn regards to his rhythm , he has an underlying right bundle branch block and first-degree AV block which were stable throughout this admission .\nHe will be followed-up by his cardiologist after discharge .\n1. PULMONARY :\nHe had a history of COPD for which he is on baseline 2 liters of 02 by nasal cannula at home and Albuterol and Atrovent MDI s p.r.n. at home .\nHe is also on Flovent MDI at home as well .\nHe was continued on his MDI and was at his baseline 02 requirement throughout admission .\n1. RENAL :\nHe has a history of chronic renal insufficiency likely secondary to hypertension and was admitted with a creatinine of 1.6 .\nHis ACE inhibitor post MI was initially held due to his creatinine .\nHowever , this responded to IV fluids and his ACE inhibitor was restarted at the time of discharge .\nHe will need close monitoring of his creatinine post discharge in the setting of reinstitution of his ACE inhibitor .\n1. GASTROINTESTINAL :\nHis stools were noted to be Guaiac positive at the outside hospital and there was still concern for possible GI bleed given continued Guaiac positive stools during this admission and a slight drop in his hematocrit from 39 to 33 .\nIt was felt most appropriate for him to have an outpatient GI workup , and his PCP was contacted and will arrange for outpatient colonoscopy .\nHis Plavix was held at the time of discharge due to a question of GI bleed and in the setting of not having a stent placed at the time of catheterization .\nHe was continued on his aspirin , however .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :\nCoronary artery disease , status post non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with 80 percent mid LAD lesion , now status post angioplasty .\nHypertension .\nChronic renal insufficiency .\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease .\nGuaiac  positive stools .\nAnemia .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\n1. Lipitor 10 mg q.d.\n2. Lisinopril 2.5 mg q.d.\n3. Flovent 110 micrograms aerosol two puffs b.i.d.\n4. Aspirin 325 mg q.d.\n5. Combivent MDI p.r.n.\n6. Toprol XL 100 mg q.d.\nDISPOSITION :\nAt the time of discharge , the patient 's vital signs were stable and he was without complaints .\nDISCHARGE STATUS :\nHe will be discharged to home and was cleared by Physical Therapy .\nFOLLOW UP :\nHe has been scheduled for follow-up with Dr. Martha on 2015-03-25 at 11:00 a.m.\nIt was discussed with him the need to schedule follow-up for colonoscopy with his PCP as well .\nHe will call the Cardiology Division at Addison Gilbert Hospital Greenfield to schedule a follow-up with his cardiologist there within the next week .\nLucile Minor Etta , MD\n12ADA\nDictated By : Emily M.

kilograms .\nBlood pressure 126/66 .\nGeneral :\nActive , well-developed , well-nourished male .\nHead and neck examination :\nNo bruits appreciated .\nLungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally .\nHeart was regular rate and rhythm .\nS1 and S2 .\n3/6 systolic ejection murmur throughout his precordium .\nHis abdomen is soft , nontender , nondistended .\nNo hepatosplenomegaly and no CVA tenderness .\nExtremities are warm , well perfused , no cyanosis , clubbing or\nedema .\nPalpable dorsalis pedis pulses .\nNo varicosities noted .\nThe patient was also noted to be right handed .\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\nHe was admitted to the cardiac surgery service for an elected Bental procedure with homograft and coronary artery bypass graft .\nOnce consent and preoperative evaluation was complete , he was taken to the operating room .\nPlease refer to the previously dictated operative note of 2016-12-30 by Dr. Lawrence .\nBriefly , the patient was taken to the operating room to repair his critical aortic stenosis , his coronary artery disease and his significantly dilated ascending aortic aneurysm .\nThe procedure was an aortic valve replacement with a tissue valve , a coronary artery bypass graft procedure where five grafts were performed .\nThe left internal mammary artery was connected to the proximal left anterior descending and saphenous vein grafts were connected to the posterior descending artery , diagonal branch , obtuse marginal and distal left anterior descending .\nFinally , a super coronary arch graft was implanted .\nThis was a .................... graft .\nCardiopulmonary bypass time was 234 minutes .\nHis aorta was cross clamped for 168 minutes .\nHe had pharmacologic circulatory arrest for 18 minutes .\nThe patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the unit , intubated on Milrinone , Levophed and Propofol drips .\nThe rest of the hospital stay can be discussed in terms of system based approach .\nPulmonary :\nThe patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .\nAfter that , the patient had no major problems with his lungs .\nHis oxygen saturations remained good and he did not require supplemental oxygen more than a couple of days after his extubation .\nHe was sent to the floor from the cardiac surgery recovery unit on postoperative day number seven .\nAfter an extended stay for hemodynamic monitoring and pressor support to maintain his perfusion .\nNeurologic :\nThe major neurologic event of this hospital course was that the patient was slow to awake after his Propofol drip was discontinued .\nBecause of his confusion , a neurology consult was obtained and subsequent radiographic imaging revealed chronic appearing infarcts in the right occipital lobe as well as both cerebellar hemispheres , suggestive of more chronic infarcts , as well as an area in the left corona radiata , adjacent to the left lateral ventricle which may or may not be an acute infarct .\nThis was seen on the CAT scan on postoperative day number one , 12-31 .\nAs the patient became more awake , he still remained somewhat confused and a little bit out of it .\nIn addition , he was noted to have a right sided hemiplegia .\nOver his postoperative course , Mr. Douglass has gradually been able to utilize more and more of his right side and with the assistance of physical therapy and occupational therapy , he has 4 to 5 + strength in his right hand and arm and about 4 + strength in his right leg .\nHe is able to walk about the floor on the days prior to discharge , with the assistance of the physical therapist and nurses .\nIn addition , Mr. Douglass is given Trazodone to help him sleep at night .\nA psychiatric consult was also obtained due to his mental status and confusion postoperatively but his psychiatric issues are mostly related to his neurologic insults and he has no distinctive psychiatric disorder , except for perhaps postoperative delirium .\nCardiovascularly , the patient did extremely well following the surgery .\nThe Levophed drip was continued until postoperative day number one .\nMilrinone was continued until postoperative day number three , at which point he was having good enough cardiac output that he did not need these drips to help maintain his blood pressure anymore .\nHe has remained without any chest pain following this procedure and his sternal wound is clean , dry and intact at the end of the procedure .\nIn addition , he has hypertension , for which he receives Metoprolol and he has hypercholesterolemia , for which he receives nothing at this time .\nPulmonary :\nThe patient remained intubated until postoperative day number five .\nHe was diuresed and was soon saturating very well on room air .\nGastrointestinal :\nThe patient has gastroesophageal reflux disease , for which he has been receiving Zantac as an inpatient .\nWe will put him back on his Nexium .\nIn addition , over the last couple of days prior to discharge , the patient did appear a little bit icteric .\nLiver function tests were obtained and they were slightly elevated liver function tests and ALT was 44 , AST was 34 ; alkaline phosphatase was 199 , within normal limits .\nTotal bilirubin was 2.8 .\nAmylase was 108 and lipase was 213 .\nA right upper quadrant ultrasound did not reveal any gallstones or common bile duct dilatation indicative of cholecystitis or cholelithiasis .\nIn addition , the patient did have slightly elevated blood sugars over the last couple of days and has required an insulin sliding scale and basal insulin to maintain his blood sugars at a more appropriate level .\nThe ideal blood sugar levels for Mr. Douglass in this postoperative period should be less than 140 .\nPlease stay on top of the sliding scale so that the patient can keep a euglycemic level .\nHematologic :\nThe patient , during this admission , required transfusion of three units of packed red blood cells to maintain adequate hematocrit .\nAt the time of discharge , Mr. Norman hematocrit is at 40.7 .\nFluids , electrolytes and nutrition :\nThe patient did receive a significant amount of diuresis postoperatively and is well below his baseline with weight , most likely because of his inability to eat because of his stroke .\nOnce he was coherent enough , the patient was evaluated by the swallow team who\ndeclared him at first an aspiration risk .\nAs Mr. Douglass has improved from his initial stroke , he has become more lucid\nand is less of an aspiration risk .\nOn 01-12 , one day prior to discharge , he was cleared by the swallow team to eat\na diet as he wishes .\nHe is going out on a cardiac healthy , diabetic diet , as tolerated with Boost supplements .\nInfectious disease :\nThe patient had positive blood and urine cultures on 01-05 for history of Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus , which was pan sensitive .\nHe was started on Oct. 25 for this bug .\nOn 01-08 , the patient 's central venous line was discontinued .\nThe catheterization tip also grew out Serratia .\nOn the 16th , a urine culture was obtained and did grow out greater than 100,000 colonies of E. coli which was intermittently resistant to Ciprofloxacin .\nHe was started on Bactrim for that .\nPlease continue Mr. David Montero for one month to fight his blood borne infection , to prevent seeding of his aortic graft and continue Bactrim for ten days after discharge to treat the E. coli in his urine .\nDISPOSITION :\nMr. Douglass is being discharged on 2017-01-13 to a rehabilitation facility in good condition .\nFOLLOW-UP :\nOne to two weeks with his primary care physician and two to three weeks with his cardiologist and at one month with Dr. Costello .\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES

Increasing large right-sided pleural effusion and pulmonary edema .\nScattered parenchymal opacities in the left lower lobe represent superimposed infection vs atelectasis .\nThere is no evidence of abscess .\n6. 2017-09-28 Chest X Ray :\nSINGLE AP VIEW OF THE CHEST .\nThere has been almost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .\nA small right pleural effusion has decreased in size .\nMild cardiomegaly is stable .\nThere is no pneumothorax .\nRight PIC catheter tip ends in the lower SVC .\nPatient is post median sternotomy .\nIMPRESSION :\nAlmost complete resolution of pulmonary edema .\n7. 2017-09-29 CT Head :\nFINDINGS :\nThere is no evidence of intraaxial or extraaxial hemorrhage , mass effect , shift of normally midline structures , or acute major or minor vascular territorial infarction .\nThe ventricles and sulci are mildly prominent , but stable in size and appearance .\nThe gray-white matter differentiation is preserved .\nAgain seen are subtle hypodensities within the periventricular white matter which is an indication of chronic microvascular ischemic changes , stable .\nExtensive carotid artery calcifications are identified .\nThe visualized paranasal sinuses are clear .\nThe surrounding osseous and soft tissue structures are unremarkable .\nIMPRESSION :\nNo evidence of acute or chronic infarction .\nStable microvascular ischemic changes in the periventricular white matter .\n8. 2017-09-30 EEG :\nIMPRESSION :\nAbnormal EEG due to the moderately slow posterior background and occasional bursts of generalized slowing .\nThese findings indicate a widespread encephalopathic condition affecting both cortical and subcortical structures .\nMedications , metabolic disturbances , and infection are among the most common causes .\nNo prominent focal abnormalities were evident , and there were no epileptiform features .\nThe cardiac monitor showed occasional irregularities in a PACED rhythm .\nBrief Hospital Course :\nA/P :\n70 y/o male with h/o CAD , T2DM , hyperlipidemia , and COPD who presented to the Juan on 2017-09-03 with worsening SOB x 5 days from Morton Hospital & Medical Center .\nPt. was initially admitted to CCU on 2017-09-03 , transferred to Pendleton on 2017-09-05 , triggered on 2017-09-10 for hypotension with BP 67/38 and transferred back to CCU on 2017-09-10 .\nHe remained fluid overloaded and a swan catheter was placed .\nThe following issues were addressed during this hospital admission :\n1# Cardiac :\nPump\nThe patient was initially admitted for likely CHF exacerbation .\nHe was started on a lasix gtt the night of admission with a good response .\nHe continued to diurese and he was moved to the floor since he no longer required intensive level care .\nWhile on the floor , he continued to be diuresed .\nAfter several days , he became hypotensive and triggered for BPs 60s/30s .\nHe was given IVF without an adequate response in his pressures .\nHe was transferred back to the CCU and started on a dopamine gtt .\nHe diuresed well on the dopamine gtt and his BP was supported .\nGradually , the dopamine gtt was weaned .\nHowever , he still appeared volume overloaded with minimal improvement in his oxygen requirement .\nA swan was placed for a more accurate picture of his volume status and he was volume overloaded by swan numbers with an elevated PAD and elevated CVP without an obtainable wedge pressure .\nHe also had a high CO and low SVR suggestive of sepsis , but he never had an elevated WBC and was afebrile during his entire hospital admission with negative blood , urine , wound , and pleural fluid cultures .\nThe Lasix drip was eventually changed to IV Lasix boluses , with a net diuresis of over 36 liters for the hospital stay .\nHe was then transitioned to oral Lasix for maintainence .\nThe patient had an echo on 2017-09-04 with the results above in detail .\nIt was unchanged in comparison to 2017-08-14 with similar ventricular function and inferior and inferolateral hypokinesis .\nThe patient had another echo on 2017-09-14 with no new changes .\nAt discharge the patient was thought to be euvolemic , satting well on room air and without peripheral edema .\nHis dry weight is 70.4 kg .\nIschemia\nThe patient had an initial troponin bump on admission which was most likely secondary to CHF exacerbation .\nHe was continued on Aspirin , Metoprolol and Lipitor with no further issues .\nRhythm\nThe patient is completely pacer-dependent , being epicardially paced at 70 .\nHe is on Amiodarone for post-op afib and this was continued this entire admission .\nHis underlying rhythm is atrial flutter ; it was unclear whether he had previously been cardioverted .\nAnti-coagulation was started with Warfarin 5 mg with a goal of 2-3 and a plan for cardioversion in 6 weeks .\nThe patient 's INR became supratherapeutic and Coumadin was held .\nHis coumadin was transitioned to 2 mg and then 1 mg .\nHis INR continued to flucuate .\nHe was discharged on 1 mg , but a stable regimen had not been achieved .\nHis INR will have to be monitored closely unitl his levels are stable .\nHis INR goal is 02-24 .\n2# SOB on admission :\nLikely due to CHF exacerbation , with diuresis of over 36 L during his admission .\nHe had 4 surgeries ( 3 cardiac surgeries ) earlier in the summer , so it is likely that he required copious IVF hydration surrounding these procedures which may have been the cause of his massive fluid overload .\nIt appears that his diet was regulated at rehab but there is concern for medication non-compliance at rehab , per previous discharge summaries .\nOn discharge , the patient was maintained on standing diuretics as well as PRN nebs and INH COPD meds .\n3# Metabolic Alkalosis / Hypochloremia :\nEtiology most likely a combination of contraction alkalosis and / or post-hypercapnia .\nThis acutely worsened on 2017-09-18 , when the patient was found to have mental status changes and an ABG revealed a CO2 of over 100 , likley due to a depressed respiratory drive secondary to sedatives given for agitation on top of a preexisting alkalosis .\nThe patient was therefore intubated for ventilation , and continued to be diuresed .\nHis CO2 improved and he was extubated after a few days .\nAll sedating medications were held and serial ABGs were trended to follow the resolution of the metabolic alkalosis .\n4# Pleural effusions : s/p right thoracentesis on 2017-09-06 , 1600 mL of serosanguinous fluid removed from right pleural space .\nGram stain and cultures were negative , cytology was negative .\nThe right pleural effusion slowly re-accumulated after tap but resolved after continued diuresis .\nRepeat CXR showed improvement of the effusion and on discharge he had been breathing well on room air without complications\n5# T2DM :\nThe patient was started on Glargine for tighter glycemic control and was covered with an insulin sliding scale .\nHe was monitored with QID fingersticks .\nHis blood sugars were in the 100s on discharge .\n6# Hyperlipidemia :\nThe patient was continued on his statin .\n7# COPD :\nThe patient was continued on nebs\n8# MS changes :\nThe patient has a history of baseline dementia which was confounded by delerium in the face of metabolic abnormalities .\nHis mental status improved as his metabolic process was resolved as detailed above .\nNeurology was also consulted and a head CT showed old lacunar infarcts but no acute causes for a change in mental status .\nAn EEG showed mild encephalopathy , but no other findings .\nHis mental status did clear somewhat with the addition of standing lactulose ; he was discharged on this medication .\n9# Hypothyroidism :\nThe patient was continued on his outpatient dose of Levothyroxine .\n10# ? UTI :\nThe patient was started on levofloxacin at Newton-Wellesley Hospital for a question of UTI based on U/A positive for WBC .\nUCx during this hospitalization were negative and Levofloxacin was d/c 'd .\n11# Chronic lower back pain :\nThe patient was treated with a Lidocaine patch and Percocet prn .\nStronger narcotics were avoided given somnolence and MS changes .\n12# Wound Care :\nThe patient has left chest wound and left gluteal pressure ulcer .\nWound care was consulted on 2017-09-05 and they made several recommendations .\nFor the left gluteal pressure ulcer , they recommended gentle cleansing with normal saline or commercial wound cleaner , thin layer of Duoderm gel , air dry , allevyn foam adhesive over the site , and change every 2 days or prn .\nFor the left chest wound , they recommended cleansing with commercial wound cleanser , pat dry , pack aquacel AG rope and moisten with saline , cover with dry gauze and change daily .\nThese recommendations were followed throughout the admission .\n13# Voiding :\nPt. failed multiple attempts to void on his own .\nCase was discussed with neurology .\nHe was started on finsateride on the day prior to admission .\nHe is scheduled to follow up with urology to address this issue .\nUntil then , his foley should remain in place .\n14# Code :\nThe patient was full code during admission .\nMedications on Admission :\nLevothyroxine 100 mcg PO daily\nDuloxetine 20 mg PO QHS\nOndansetron PRN\nPercocet 1 tab PRN\nSenna PRN\nColace PRN\nLasix 80 mg PO BID\nLactulose PRN\nLidocaine patch\nNystatin powder\nGabapentin 300 mg PO TID\nAlb nebs\nFluticasone / Salmeterol\nTiotropium Bromide\nSpironolactone 25 mg PO daily\nEpoetin 4000 units MWF\nRISS\nAmiodarone 200 mg PO daily\nCalcium Acetate 667 mg PO TID\nSubQ Heparin\nPantoprazole 40 mg PO daily\nSimvastatin 40 mg PO QHS\nASA 81 mg PO daily\nMVI\nTylenol PRN\nDischarge Medications :\n1.

When his O2 saturation was monitored , his pulse oximetry remained in the 90s during his stay .\n2. His non-essential medications that may have been contributing to his change in mental status were discontinued ; those included Temocillin , Nortriptyline , Haldol , Lorazepam , Venlafaxine , Bupropion , and Gabapentin .\nIn addition , his cyclosporin levels were checked .\n3. Hypo or hyperglycemia :\nMahoney had been following with their appreciated recommendations on glucose control .\nFinger sticks were in the 150 s when acutely agitated , therefore , it was not determined that glucose levels were contributory .\n4. Infectious causes were evaluated .\nHe was febrile in the Intensive Care Unit to 101.0 F. ; yet , chest x-ray , blood cultures , urinalysis and urine cultures were all negative for sources .\nA lumbar puncture was considered , although not performed due to the fact that the cerebrospinal fluid was not breached during the procedure .\n5. Mass effect was considered , although no focal deficits were ever noted on examination and due to the fluctuating sensorium , it was determined that there was no severe underlying structural abnormality .\nA head and neck CT scan , non-contrast , were ordered though to evaluate for such processes .\nNo acute intracranial hemorrhages or midline shifts were noted , although a soft tissue mass was noted at the level of C2 .\nThis was determined to be within the normal expected changes post surgery .\n6. Trauma was also considered .\nThe patient was found out of bed but no signs of head trauma , no loss of consciousness .\nThroughout his stay , Chem-10 was monitored .\nThere were no electrolytes or mineral abnormalities that could explain his delirium .\nLiver function tests were checked , only total bilirubin was slightly elevated at 1.6 .\nTSH was within normal limits as was B12 and folate .\nRPR evaluating for possible neurologic syphilis was also checked .\nThe assay was nonreactive .\nAn EEG was also considered to rule out non-convulsive status epilepticus , although again this did not seem to be a likely cause .\nOn the evening of the 22nd , the patient became acutely agitated , threatening to leave , and also threatening to harm those nurses and physicians that were attempting to prevent him from leaving .\nSecurity was notified who then arrived to the room and helped to place the patient in four-point\nrestraints , for the safety of both the patient and the staff of the hospital .\nThe restraints were weaned off overnight although he became acutely agitated and they were replaced early on 08-31 .\nLater in the morning on 08-31 , the patient was more oriented and alert , and asked to have the restraints removed .\nThey were taken off two at a time .\nThe patient continued to do well and did not require restraints after that event .\nIntramuscular as well as intravenous Haldol were ordered p.r.n. for emergency use should he become acutely agitated .\nhaldol as well as the restraints were not required after the morning of the 23rd .\nEach progressive day,  Mr. Donald delirium abated with return to baseline mental status early on 09-01 .\nThe likely cause of the delirium was a combination of surgery and Intensive Care Unit stay in addition to poly-pharmacy .\nOther concerns during his stay was his kidney function , due to his renal transplant in 2003 .\nHis immunosuppressive therapy was continued throughout his stay ; his creatinine remained approximately 2.3 to 2.4 ; he has a baseline renal insufficiency .\nWith this in mind , when obtaining a CT scan it was determined that contrast would not be the best option .\nWhile the patient was in restraints , gentle hydration was initiated since p.o. intake was not adequate .\nAs for his diabetes mellitus , the Mahoney Team provided updated recommendations each day , adjusting for the changing p.o. intake .\nThe only other complaints from Mr. Mackey during his stay were :\nSoreness at his operative sites , for which he was given p.r.n. Tylenol once his delirium had resolved .\nIn addition , he also complained of difficulty with swallowing , necessitating only soft and liquid diet .\nThis was attributed to postoperative swelling and changes from his diskectomy performed 2010-08-27 .\nDISPOSITION :\nThe patient was discharged on 09-02 .\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\n1. Follow-up with Dr. Williams on Tuesday , 09-07 , at noon .\n2. Follow-up with Dr. Michael , his psychiatrist , on Wednesday , 09-08 .\n3. He was also discharged home with Visiting Nurse Association for Physical Therapy evaluation of home safety .\nDISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\n1. Venlafaxine XR 75 mg q. a.m.\n2. Furosemide 20 mg q.o.d.\n3. Metoprolol 100 mg twice a day .\n4. Nitroglycerin sublingual 0.3 mg p.r.n.\n5. Cyclosporin microemulsion .\n6. Neoral 100 mg twice a day .\n7. Zithropren 50 mg q. day .\n8. Prednisone 10 mg q. day .\n9. Minoxidil 10 mg twice a day .\n10. Prilosec 20 mg q. day .\n11. NPH 30 units q. a.m. , 5 to 6 units q. p.m.\n12.

Bucket handle medial meniscal tear with flipped fragment in the intercondylar notch .\nComplex tear involving the posterior Ellison and body .\n2. Moderate knee joint effusion with possible ganglion cyst at the insertion of the PCL .\n3. Discoid lateral meniscus .\nBrief Hospital Course :\nMr. Anders was admitted for anticoagulation and hemodynamic monitoring in the setting of saddle pulmonary embolus and left knee injury .\n#. PE :\nGiven no other risk factors or likely causes , the most likely etiology for his embolus is DVT from the left leg .\nHe has no known clotting disorder but did have trauma to leg prompting immobility and stasis .\nHe remained hemodynmically stable throughout his hospitalization and did not have an oxygen requirement upon discharge .\nGiven no evidence of hemodynamic instability , lysis was not required .\nHe was anticoagulated with heparin and coumadin .\nHe will need to follow up with hematology for an outpatient thrombophilia work-up ( not done as inpatient as results would not change acute management of PE ).\nHe will also require close follow up with his primary care provider for coumadin management .\nDuration of his coumadin therapy to be determined by hematology , but likely to be at least 6 months in duration .\n#. Syncope :\nIn setting of PE .\nRemainder of his cardiac workup was negative .\nHe did have a small troponin leak , felt to be related to right heart strain in the setting of P-pulmonale related to clot burden .\nHis tronponin quickly trended down and he did not have EKG evidence of ischemia .\nAn ECHO did not reveal any wall motion abnormalities related to ischemia .\n#. Hematocrit :\nDropped from 42.7 to 36 in setting of anticoagulation for saddle PE and IV fluids .\nNo active bleeding noted .\nPt asymptomatic .\n#. L knee injury :\nGiven his history and physical exam , Mr. Anders presented with an injury most consistent with meniscal tear .\nIn order to facilitate therapy and to promote mobility , an MRI of the knee was done .\nHe was seen by physical therapy and will need to follow up with orthopaedics upon discharge for repeat evaluation .\n#.
